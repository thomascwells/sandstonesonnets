    "text": "Near Fruita stands a rock so odd,\nThe angry bird was on his perch, A sandstone fowl of flaming red. His beak so sharp, his eyes so mean, He’d scare your iPhone half to dead!\nNo slingshot needed for this dude, He’s permanently set to “RAGE”— The only bird who’s been on tilt Since long before the Ice Age!\nTourists point and laugh with glee, “Look, honey! He’s from that phone game!” While geologists just roll their eyes: “It’s erosion, folks—but sure, same same!”"

    "text": "High up in Devil’s Canyon wall, A cheeky smile grins down at all— Red rock carved by wind and time, Playing nature’s favorite rhyme.\nGreen trees giggle from above, Junipers whisper tales of love, While hikers stop and point with glee: “Look! The mountain’s smiling at me!”\nThis sandstone jester never frowns, Just grins at all the desert towns, A billion-year-old happy face That makes Colorado such a place!\nSo if you’re walking Fruita’s trails And need a laugh when courage fails, Just look up at that crimson wall— The canyon’s smiling after all!"
