    "text": "Perched in the desert, proud and absurd,\nA sandstone cliff — an Angry Bird.\nIts beak juts sharp, its brow is stern,\nAs if awaiting its turn to burn.\nThe wind plays slingshot, the clouds take aim,\nBut this rock just chuckles, immune to the game.\nForever frozen in feathery guise,\nA grumpy guardian under bluebird skies.\nLizards parade by its scowling face,\nWhispering tales of its lofty place.\nTourists snap photos, delighted to find,\nA relic of pixels in stone redefined.\nAnd when twilight paints the canyon red,\nThe Angry Bird will live on in your head —\nA game once played on a glowing screen,\nNow etched by time in a desert scene."

    "text": "If you wander where the waters run,\nPast sandstone cliffs in the desert sun,\nYou’ll find a beast both strange and sly,\nWith wooden jaws that snap the sky.\nIts tail is curled beneath itself,\nA driftwood gator perched on the shelf.\nOr maybe some old canyon sprite,\nWho guards the Inner Flume by day and night.\nHikers stop with wide-eyed cheer:\n“Look! A dragon’s waiting here!”\nCarved by flood and nature’s play,\nIt roars only to scare the dust away.\nSo if you roam above the Flume’s embrace,\nAnd stumble on this creature’s place,\nJust wave and laugh, don’t be afraid —\nThe canyon’s myths are all homemade!"

Merchant? Who’s to say?\nHis eyes are gone, worn smooth by time,\nYet still he keeps a watch sublime.\nFlume canyon rests beneath his gaze,\nAn old prospector from those bygone days?\nSo give a nod as you pass on by,\nThis stoic stranger won’t reply.\nBut desert varnish keeps him near,\nA patinaed figure from yesteryear."
