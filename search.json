    "text": "Perched in the desert, proud and absurd,\nA sandstone cliff — an Angry Bird.\nIts beak juts sharp, its brow is stern,\nAs if awaiting its turn to burn.\nThe wind plays slingshot, the clouds take aim,\nBut this rock just chuckles, immune to the game.\nForever frozen in feathery guise,\nA grumpy guardian under bluebird skies.\nLizards parade by its scowling face,\nWhispering tales of its lofty place.\nTourists snap photos, delighted to find,\nA relic of pixels in stone redefined.\nAnd when twilight paints the canyon red,\nThe Angry Bird will live on in your head —\nA game once played on a glowing screen,\nNow etched by time in a desert scene."

    "text": "If you wander where the cliffs stand high,\nA breaching whale will catch your eye.\nIts sandstone flukes once crashed the sea,\nAnd wrecked a ship for all to see.\nThe vessel lingered, ghostly drawn,\nIts sails were torn, its crew long gone.\nYet its ghostly shell still remains,\nA sandstone hull upon the plain.\nThe whale looks proud, a trickster bold,\nA million years of tales retold.\nWhile desert winds still sing a song:\nThe whale’s been laughing all along.\nSo if you stroll these rugged lands,\nWith dust and wonder in your hands,\nLook close — the tale is clear:\nA whale sunk that ship right here!"

    "text": "If you search the canyon wall,\nA cheeky smile grins down at all.\nRed rock carved by wind and time,\nSharing nature’s favorite rhyme.\nGreen trees giggle from above,\nJunipers whisper tales of love.\nWhile hikers stop and point with glee:\n“Look! The canyon’s smiling at me!”\nThis sandstone jester never frowns,\nJust grins at all the desert towns.\nA million-year-old happy face,\nThat makes D4 such a lovely place!\nSo if you’re walking Fruita’s trails\nAnd need a laugh when courage fails,\nJust look up at that crimson wall—\nThe canyon’s smiling after all!"

    "text": "If you wander where the waters run,\nPast sandstone cliffs in the desert sun,\nYou’ll find a beast both strange and sly,\nWith wooden jaws that snap the sky.\nIts tail is curled beneath itself,\nA driftwood gator perched on the shelf.\nOr maybe some old canyon sprite,\nWho guards the Inner Flume by day and night.\nHikers stop with wide-eyed cheer:\n“Look! A dragon’s waiting here!”\nCarved by flood and nature’s play,\nIt roars only to scare the dust away.\nSo if you roam above the Flume’s embrace,\nAnd stumble on this creature’s place,\nJust wave and laugh, don’t be afraid —\nThe canyon’s myths are all homemade!"
