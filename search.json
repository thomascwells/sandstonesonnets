Select a trail to explore.\nThe “Poems” section will now be filtered to just the trail selected.\nFeatures on out-and-back trails are numbered sequentially, in the order they are found on the hike in. Features on loop trails are numbered in a clockwise fashion. If you’re hiking counter-clockwise, you’ll see them in reverse order.\nEach poem will give you clues about what shape to look for in the rocks. If you’re stuck, there are hints at the bottom of the page under each poem. Clicking the hint will expand it.\nOnce you think you’ve found the rock formation described in the poem, click the “Answer” tab. It will show you a picture of the formation and a map showing the location where the picture was taken.\n\n\nI hate to tell you this, but these aren’t sonnets.\nI hate to tell you this, but that isn’t a question. Nonetheless, your point is a good one – these aren’t sonnets. We liked the alliteration of Sandstone Sonnets more than we liked actual sonnets.\n\n\nI think the rocks look like something different. How can I let you know?\nEmail us! We love hearing from readers. If you have a suggestion for a different shape or interpretation, please let us know!\n\n\nCan I submit a poem to Sandstone Sonnets?\nFor sure! Send us an email! Please include the trailhead and trail section you are writing about, as well as any hints you think would be helpful. We reserve the right to edit submissions for clarity, but you will receive credit for your poem."
