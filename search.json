    "text": "The angry bird was on his perch,\nA sandstone fowl of flaming red.\nHis beak so sharp, his eyes so mean,\nHe’d scare your iPhone half to dead!\nNo slingshot needed for this dude,\nHe’s permanently set to “RAGE”—\nThe only bird who’s been on tilt\nSince long before the Ice Age!\nTourists point and laugh with glee,\n“Look, honey! He’s from that phone game!”\nWhile geologists just roll their eyes:\n“It’s erosion, folks—but sure, same same!”"

The canyon’s smiling at me!”\nThis sandstone jester never frowns,\nJust grins at all the desert towns.\nA million-year-old happy face,\nThat makes D4 such a place!\nSo if you’re walking Fruita’s trails\nAnd need a laugh when courage fails,\nJust look up at that crimson wall—\nThe canyon’s smiling after all!"

    "text": "If you wander where the cliffs stand high,\nA breaching whale will catch your eye.\nIts sandstone flukes once crashed the sea,\nAnd wrecked a ship for all to see.\nThe vessel lingered, ghostly drawn,\nIts sails were torn, its crew long gone.\nYet its ghostly shell still remains,\nA sandstone hull upon the plain.\nThe whale looks proud, a trickster bold,\nA million years of tales retold.\nWhile desert winds still sing a song:\nThe whale’s been laughing all along.\nSo if you stroll these rugged lands,\nWith dust and wonder in your hands,\nLook close — the tale is clear:\nA whale sunk that ship right here!"
