### How do I use this website?

Use the "Trailhead filters" section on the homepage to find a trail near you. Select a trail to explore.  

The "Poems" section will now be filtered to just the trail selected.

Features on out-and-back trails are numbered sequentially, in the order they are found on the hike in. Features on loop trails are numbered in a clockwise fashion. If you're hiking counter-clockwise, you'll see them in reverse order.  

Each poem will give you clues about what shape to look for in the rocks. If you're stuck, there are hints at the bottom of the page under each poem. Clicking the hint will expand it.

Once you think you've found the rock formation described in the poem, click the "Answer" tab. It will show you a picture of the formation and a map showing the location where the picture was taken.

### I hate to tell you this, but these aren't sonnets.

I hate to tell you this, but that isn't a question. Nonetheless, your point is a good one -- these aren't sonnets. We liked the alliteration of Sandstone Sonnets more than we liked actual sonnets.

### I think the rocks look like something different. How can I let you know?
