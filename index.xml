<p>If you search the Devil’s Canyon wall, A cheeky smile grins down at all. Red rock carved by wind and time, Playing nature’s favorite rhyme.</p>
<p>Green trees giggle from above, Junipers whisper tales of love. While hikers stop and point with glee: “Look! The canyon’s smiling at me!”</p>
<p>This sandstone jester never frowns, Just grins at all the desert towns. A million-year-old happy face, That makes D4 such a place!</p>
<p>So if you’re walking Fruita’s trails And need a laugh when courage fails, Just look up at that crimson wall— The canyon’s smiling after all!</p>

  <title>The Dapper Duck of Fruita</title>

<p>Near Fruita stands a rock so odd,<br>
A sandstone duck that gives a nod.<br>
With fancy hat perched on its head,<br>
It looks like royalty instead!</p>
<p>This stony fowl with fashion sense<br>
Makes tourists stop in pure suspense.<br>
“Is that a duck wearing a hat?”<br>
“Or am I high?” (It might be that!)</p>
<p>The Colorado winds may blow,<br>
But duckie’s hat won’t ever go.<br>
The only bird that’s truly cool—<br>
It never quacks and doesn’t drool!</p>
<p>While other ducks must swim and fly,<br>
This one just winks at passers-by.<br>
The fanciest rock you’ll ever see—<br>
With zero bills for you and me!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The angry bird was on his perch, A sandstone fowl of flaming red. His beak so sharp, his eyes so mean, He’d scare your iPhone half to dead!</p>
<p>No slingshot needed for this dude, He’s permanently set to “RAGE”— The only bird who’s been on tilt Since long before the Ice Age!</p>
<p>Tourists point and laugh with glee, “Look, honey! He’s from that phone game!” While geologists just roll their eyes: “It’s erosion, folks—but sure, same same!”</p>
