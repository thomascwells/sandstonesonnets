  <title>Guardian of the Canyon Wall</title>

<p>If you wander where the waters run,<br>
Past sandstone cliffs in the desert sun,<br>
You’ll find a beast both strange and sly,<br>
With wooden jaws that snap the sky.</p>
<p>Its tail is curled beneath itself,<br>
A driftwood gator perched on the shelf.<br>
Or maybe some old canyon sprite,<br>
Who guards the Inner Flume by day and night.</p>
<p>Hikers stop with wide-eyed cheer:<br>
“Look! A dragon’s waiting here!”<br>
Carved by flood and nature’s play,<br>
It roars only to scare the dust away.</p>
<p>So if you roam above the Flume’s embrace,<br>
And stumble on this creature’s place,<br>
Just wave and laugh, don’t be afraid —<br>
The canyon’s myths are all homemade!</p>

  <title>The Desert Shipwreck</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>If you wander where the cliffs stand high,<br>
A breaching whale will catch your eye.<br>
Its sandstone flukes once crashed the sea,<br>
And wrecked a ship for all to see.</p>
<p>The vessel lingered, ghostly drawn,<br>
Its sails were torn, its crew long gone.<br>
Yet its ghostly shell still remains,<br>
A sandstone hull upon the plain.</p>
<p>The whale looks proud, a trickster bold,<br>
A million years of tales retold.<br>
While desert winds still sing a song:<br>
The whale’s been laughing all along.</p>
<p>So if you stroll these rugged lands,<br>
With dust and wonder in your hands,<br>
Look close — the tale is clear:<br>
A whale sunk that ship right here!</p>

  <title>The Canyon’s Secret Grin</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>If you search the canyon wall,<br>
A cheeky smile grins down at all.<br>
Red rock carved by wind and time,<br>
Sharing nature’s favorite rhyme.</p>
<p>Green trees giggle from above,<br>
Junipers whisper tales of love.<br>
While hikers stop and point with glee:<br>
“Look! The canyon’s smiling at me!”</p>
<p>This sandstone jester never frowns,<br>
Just grins at all the desert towns.<br>
A million-year-old happy face,<br>
That makes D4 such a lovely place!</p>
<p>So if you’re walking Fruita’s trails<br>
And need a laugh when courage fails,<br>
Just look up at that crimson wall—<br>
The canyon’s smiling after all!</p>

  <title>The Dapper Duck of Fruita</title>
  <dc:creator>Rudy </dc:creator>
  <link>https://thomascwells.com/sandstonesonnets/poems/dapper-duck.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Near Fruita stands a rock so odd,<br>
A sandstone duck that gives a nod.<br>
With fancy hat perched on its head,<br>
It looks like royalty instead!</p>
<p>This stony fowl with fashion sense<br>
Makes tourists stop in pure suspense.<br>
“Is that a duck wearing a hat?”<br>
“Or am I stoned?” (It might be that!)</p>
<p>The Colorado winds may blow,<br>
But duckie’s hat won’t ever go.<br>
While other ducks must swim and fly,<br>
This one just winks at passers-by.</p>

  <title>Red Rock Fury</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Perched in the desert, proud and absurd,<br>
A sandstone cliff — an Angry Bird.<br>
Its beak juts sharp, its brow is stern,<br>
As if awaiting its turn to burn.</p>
<p>The wind plays slingshot, the clouds take aim,<br>
But this rock just chuckles, immune to the game.<br>
Forever frozen in feathery guise,<br>
A grumpy guardian under bluebird skies.</p>
<p>Lizards parade by its scowling face,<br>
Whispering tales of its lofty place.<br>
Tourists snap photos, delighted to find,<br>
A relic of pixels in stone redefined.</p>
<p>And when twilight paints the canyon red,<br>
The Angry Bird will live on in your head —<br>
A game once played on a glowing screen,<br>
Now etched by time in a desert scene.</p>
