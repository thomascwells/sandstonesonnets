  <title>The Desert Shipwreck</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>If you wander where the cliffs stand high,<br>
A breaching whale will catch your eye.<br>
Its granite flukes once crashed the sea,<br>
And wrecked a ship for all to see.</p>
<p>The vessel cracked on canyon stone,<br>
Its sails now torn, its crew long gone.<br>
Yet its ghostly shell still remains,<br>
A sandstone hull upon the plain.</p>
<p>The whale looks proud, a trickster bold,<br>
A million years of tales retold.<br>
While desert winds still sing the song: The whale’s been laughing all along.</p>
<p>So if you stroll these rugged lands,<br>
With dust and wonder in your hands,<br>
Look close—the tale is clear:<br>
A whale sunk that ship right here!</p>

  <title>The Canyon’s Secret Grin</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>If you search the Devil’s Canyon wall,<br>
A cheeky smile grins down at all.<br>
Red rock carved by wind and time,<br>
Playing nature’s favorite rhyme.</p>
<p>Green trees giggle from above,<br>
Junipers whisper tales of love.<br>
While hikers stop and point with glee:<br>
“Look! The canyon’s smiling at me!”</p>
<p>This sandstone jester never frowns,<br>
Just grins at all the desert towns.<br>
A million-year-old happy face,<br>
That makes D4 such a place!</p>
<p>So if you’re walking Fruita’s trails<br>
And need a laugh when courage fails,<br>
Just look up at that crimson wall—<br>
The canyon’s smiling after all!</p>

  <title>The Dapper Duck of Fruita</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Near Fruita stands a rock so odd,<br>
A sandstone duck that gives a nod.<br>
With fancy hat perched on its head,<br>
It looks like royalty instead!</p>
<p>This stony fowl with fashion sense<br>
Makes tourists stop in pure suspense.<br>
“Is that a duck wearing a hat?”<br>
“Or am I high?” (It might be that!)</p>
<p>The Colorado winds may blow,<br>
But duckie’s hat won’t ever go.<br>
The only bird that’s truly cool—<br>
It never quacks and doesn’t drool!</p>
<p>While other ducks must swim and fly,<br>
This one just winks at passers-by.<br>
The fanciest rock you’ll ever see—<br>
With zero bills for you and me!</p>

  <title>Red Rock Fury</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The angry bird was on his perch,<br>
A sandstone fowl of flaming red.<br>
His beak so sharp, his eyes so mean,<br>
He’d scare your iPhone half to dead!</p>
<p>No slingshot needed for this dude,<br>
He’s permanently set to “RAGE”—<br>
The only bird who’s been on tilt<br>
Since long before the Ice Age!</p>
<p>Tourists point and laugh with glee,<br>
“Look, honey! He’s from that phone game!”<br>
While geologists just roll their eyes:<br>
“It’s erosion, folks—but sure, same same!”</p>
