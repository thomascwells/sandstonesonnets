If you venture where the cliffs stand high,  
A breaching whale will catch your eye.  
Its sandstone flukes once crashed the sea,  
And wrecked a ship for all to see.  

The vessel lingered, ghostly drawn,  
Its sails were torn, its crew long gone.  
Yet its ghostly shell still remains,  
A sandstone hull upon the plain.  

The whale looks proud, a trickster bold,  
A million years of tales retold.  
While desert winds still sing a song:  
The whaleâ€™s been laughing all along.  

So if you stroll these rugged lands,  
With dust and wonder in your hands,  
Look close, the tale is clear:  
A whale sunk that ship right here!

## Hint #1: Help...what am I looking for?

You are searching for two large rocks. One of them looks like a whale breaching out of the water. Behind it, you'll find another rock that looks like a sinking ship.
