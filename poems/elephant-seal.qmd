Beside the path of Monument fame,  
A curious rock has earned its name.  
Big snout skyward, mouth open wide,  
Yikes! An elephant seal — better hide!  

Perhaps it's mid-yawn, or maybe mid-story,   
Sharing epics of its former glory.  
Or maybe, I have a hunch,  
That it's sizing up a hiker’s lunch.  

Some say it’s telling tales,  
Of ancient seas and fossilized whales.  
Others swear they’ve heard it snore,  
When canyon winds begin to roar.

So if you pass and hear a sound,  
A gravelly groan from rocky ground,  
Just tip your hat and keep your stride,  
In case that seal has an appetite!
