Beside the trail of Monument fame,  
A curious rock earns its name.  
Large snout, mouth open wide  
Yikes, an elephant seal - should I try to hide?  

Maybe it's mid-yawn, or maybe mid-story,  
Sharing epics of former glory.  
Or maybe, I have a hunch,  
It's sizing up a hiker’s lunch.  

Some say it’s telling tales,  
Of ancient seas and fossil whales.  
Others swear they’ve heard it snore,  
When twilight hums and shadows pour.  

So if you pass by and hear a sound,  
A gravel groan from rocky ground,  
Just tip your hat and keep your stride,  
In case that seal has an appetite!
