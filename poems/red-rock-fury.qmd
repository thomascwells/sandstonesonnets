Perched in the desert, proud and absurd,  
A sandstone cliff — an Angry Bird.  
Its beak juts sharp, its brow is stern,  
As if awaiting its turn to burn.  

The wind plays slingshot, the clouds take aim,  
But this rock just chuckles, immune to the game.  
Forever frozen in feathery guise,  
A grumpy guardian under bluebird skies.  

Lizards parade by its scowling face,  
Whispering tales of its lofty place.  
Tourists snap photos, delighted to find,  
A relic of pixels in stone redefined.  

And when twilight paints the canyon red,  
The Angry Bird will live on in your head —  
A game once played on a glowing screen,  
Now etched by time in a desert scene.
