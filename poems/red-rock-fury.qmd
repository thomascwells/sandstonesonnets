The angry bird was on his perch,
A sandstone fowl of flaming red.
His beak so sharp, his eyes so mean,
He'd scare your iPhone half to dead!

No slingshot needed for this dude,
He's permanently set to "RAGE"—
The only bird who's been on tilt
Since long before the Ice Age!

Tourists point and laugh with glee,
"Look, honey! He's from that phone game!"
While geologists just roll their eyes:
"It's erosion, folks—but sure, same same!"
