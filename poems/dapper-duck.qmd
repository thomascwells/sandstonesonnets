Near Fruita stands a rock so odd,  
A sandstone duck that gives a nod.  
With fancy hat perched on its head,  
It looks like royalty instead!

This stony fowl with fashion sense  
Makes tourists stop in pure suspense.  
"Is that a duck wearing a hat?"  
"Or am I stoned?" (It might be that!)

The Colorado winds may blow,  
But duckie's hat won't ever go.  
While other ducks must swim and fly,  
This one just winks at passers-by.
