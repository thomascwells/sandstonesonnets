Near Fruita stands a rock so odd,  
A sandstone duck that gives a nod.  
With fancy hat perched on its head,  
It looks like royalty instead!

This stony fowl with fashion sense  
Makes tourists stop in pure suspense.  
"Is that a duck wearing a hat?"  
"Or am I high?" (It might be that!)

The Colorado winds may blow,  
But duckie's hat won't ever go.  
The only bird that's truly cool—  
It never quacks and doesn't drool!

While other ducks must swim and fly,  
This one just winks at passers-by.  
The fanciest rock you'll ever see—  
With zero bills for you and me!
