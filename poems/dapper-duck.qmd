Near Fruita stands a rock so odd,  
A sandstone duck that gives a nod.  
With jaunty hat upon its crown,  
It seems the best-dressed bird in town.  

This fashion-forward desert friend,  
Makes travelers pause around the bend.  
“Is that a duck? With hat so grand?”  
Kids shout with glee and wave a hand.  

The Colorado winds may blow,  
But duckie’s hat won’t ever go.  
It sits there firm through hail and rain,  
A rocky, regal hat domain.  

Some say he guards the trail each day,  
A sandstone scout along the way.  
While other ducks splash and glide,  
This one just watches, brims with  pride.  

And everyone who happens by,  
Can’t help but grin and look up high.  
For nestled in the desert flat,  
Is Fruita’s duck, the one in the hat.
