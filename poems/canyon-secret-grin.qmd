If you search the Devil's Canyon wall,
A cheeky smile grins down at all.
Red rock carved by wind and time,
Playing nature's favorite rhyme.

Green trees giggle from above,
Junipers whisper tales of love.
While hikers stop and point with glee:
"Look! The canyon's smiling at me!"

This sandstone jester never frowns,
Just grins at all the desert towns.
A million-year-old happy face,
That makes D4 such a place!

So if you're walking Fruita's trails
And need a laugh when courage fails,
Just look up at that crimson wallâ€”
The canyon's smiling after all!
