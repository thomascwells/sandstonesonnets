If you wander where the waters run,  
Past sandstone cliffs in desert sun,  
You’ll find a beast both strange and sly,  
With wooden jaws that snap the sky.  

Its tail is curled beneath itself,  
A driftwood gator perched on the shelf.  
Or maybe some old canyon sprite,  
Who guards the Inner Flume day and night.  

Hikers stop with wide-eyed cheer:  
“Look! A dragon’s waiting here!”  
Carved by flood and nature’s play,  
Its roar scares only the dust away.  

So if you roam above the Flume’s embrace,  
And stumble on this creature’s place,  
Just wave and laugh, don’t be afraid —  
The canyon’s myths are all homemade!
