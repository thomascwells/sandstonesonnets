Upon a bench of sandstone, rusty-red,  
A cheeky rock tips sunset as a hat!  
No mushroom cap—but *UFO* instead—  
That parked here just to watch the coyotes chat.  
No cousin rocks in sight, it stands alone,  
While fairies leave their teacups in its cracks,  
And giggling canyons toss it seeds of stone,  
As if it *danced* here (wearing crimson socks!).  
It winks at clouds: "I’m not from outer space—  
Just Earth’s own joke! A giggling, grinning gnome!"  
The wind agrees and gives its cap a chase,  
Then tucks a sagebrush *bonnet* for it home.  
So next you pass this whimsical, red throne,  
Wave high—the rock might toss you back a stone!
