Look across the canyon face,  
A weathered man holds his place.  
With hair of brown and moustache too,  
A coat of varnish, earthen hue.  

No brush has touched this rocky wall,  
Yet nature’s paint outshines them all.  
A portrait formed in desert glaze,  
Was he a sheriff? Merchant? Who's to say?  

His eyes are gone, worn smooth by time,  
Yet still he keeps a watch sublime.  
Flume canyon rests beneath his gaze,  
An old prospector from those bygone days?  

So give a nod as you pass on by,  
This stoic stranger won’t reply.  
But desert varnish keeps him near,  
A patinaed figure from yesteryear.
