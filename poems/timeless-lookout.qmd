Peeking down from the K12 rim,  
Two giant eyes, both wide and slim.  
Hikers glance up, grin with delight:  
“Hey look! The cliff, what a sight!”  

Carved by wind with gentle care,  
Round guardians perched high up there.  
They'll sometimes twinkle in the midday sun,  
As if to say, “Go on, have some fun!”  

The steady gaze, so calm and wise,  
Instills courage from those mighty eyes.  
And when the canyon shadows creep,  
They stand guard as cliffs drift off to sleep.  

A watchful friend of rock and sky,  
Who sees the seasons wander by.  
Never blinking when the breezes fly,  
A timeless lookout from on high.
