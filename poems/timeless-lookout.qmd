Peeking across the K12 trail,  
Two wide eyes tell a tale.  
Hikers pause, marveling at the sight,  
Round guardians in the morning light.  

Sometimes they sparkle, sometimes they wink,  
As if to say, “Pause here, take a drink.”  
They stare down the wind, chuckle at the dust,  
And remind every traveler: adventure is a must.  

They’ve seen foxes tiptoe, hawks take flight,  
Storm clouds gather and fade from sight.  
On occasion, rattlesnakes slither by,  
And coyote songs ring to the sky.  

Through seasons’ dance and shifting sand,  
They’ve watched the canyon, proud and grand.  
The eyes don’t blink, they only see,  
All the stories of what was and what will be.
